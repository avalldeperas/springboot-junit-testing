# Java Unit Testing

Java Unit 5 testing with Spring Boot 2.3.1 and Mockito Frameworks,
JsonAssert, Hamcrest & JsonPatch.

#### Overview
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is the most popular framework to develop
RESTful Services and it has great Unit Testing capabilities
through Spring Boot Starter Test. 
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is the most popular Java Unit Testing framework.
* [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) is the most popular mocking framework. 

This project goal is to learn to write independent and good unit tests for 
RESTful webservices talking with multiple layers: web, business and data. 

#### JUnit 5 vs JUnit 4
Functionally speaking, JUnit 5 is as simple as JUnit 4.
There are just a few simple annotation changes:
